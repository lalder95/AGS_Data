This week's matchup between Slicknick11 and mlthomas5095 was a tale of two teams. On one side, you had Slicknick11, who came into the game with an impressive 2-1 record and a total team score of 361 points. On the other side, you had mlthomas5095, who entered the game with an 0-3 record and a total team score of 289 points. It was clear from the start that this would be an uphill battle for mlthomas5095. 

The first half of the game was all about Deshaun Watson for Slicknick11. He put up 25.16 points on his own, which is no small feat in our league where the average total team score is around 125 points per week. His performance set the tone for the rest of his team, who were able to put up 118.3 points as a whole - good enough to beat out their opponent by 28 points! 

On the other side, Kirk Cousins led mlthomas5095 with 31.68 points - but it wasn't enough to make up for his teammates' lackluster performances. AJ Dillon only managed 3.3 points while Nelson Agholor scored 7.9 - both well below their expected output based on our league's average total team score of 125 per week. The result? A lopsided victory for Slicknick11 and another loss for mlthomas5095 - ouch! 

The MVP of this matchup has to go to Deshaun Watson for his 25+ point performance that set the tone early on in this game and helped propel Slicknick11 to victory.

In what ended up being a blowout win for Slicknick11 (118-90), it's clear that they are one of the top contenders in our league right now and have what it takes to make a deep playoff run if they can keep up their current level of play! Meanwhile, mlthomas5095 will need some serious improvement if they want any chance at making it into postseason contention come Week 15! Final Score: 118-90 in favor of Slicknick11!

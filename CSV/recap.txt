Game 1:
"AGS Championship Game Decides Winner!" 

The AGS Championship game is here and it's between lalder and jwalwer81! It was a close battle for the top spot in the league all season long, but only one team could come out on top. Let's see who that will be! 

Top scorers for lalder were Patrick Mahomes (31.52 points), D'Andre Swift (27.7 points) and James Conner (14 points). Meanwhile, Justin Herbert (20.68 points), Christian McCaffrey (31.3 points) and Najee Harris (20.3 points) provided the firepower for jwalwer81's team this week. 

Bottom scorers were Ja'Marr Chase (0 points) for lalder and Amon-Ra St Brown (10.2 points) for jwalwer81 - both had forgettable weeks to say the least! 

This matchup featured two of the best teams in the league going head-to-head, so it was no surprise that this one came down to the wire. Both teams had their fair share of big plays throughout the game, with some spectacular performances from players like Tyreek Hill, A.J Brown, Dalton Schultz and Keenan Allen on jwalwer81's side, while Jordan Akins and Josh Allen kept lalder in contention with some clutch plays of their own. 

In the end though, it was jwalwer81 who emerged victorious with an impressive 172.66 total points - 81 more than their opponent! Congratulations to them on winning this year's AGS Championship title! On the other hand, lalder put up a good fight but just couldn't quite get there in the end - 91.54 total points wasn't enough to take home the trophy this time around unfortunately. 

The MVP of this matchup has to go to Christian McCaffrey who put up 31.3 fantasy football points for jwalwer81 - leading his team to victory! The biggest bust of this matchup would have to be Ja'Marr Chase who failed to contribute anything at all for lalder - ouch!  

It was a great game between two heavyweights of our fantasy football league, but in the end there can only be one winner - congratulations again to jwalwer81 on taking home first place with a final score of 172.66-91.54!

Game 2:
"Schoontang vs LucDart: Third Place Decided!"

Aaron Rodgers had a great week, putting up 18.56 points in the matchup. Jerick McKinnon also put up 22.6 points for Schoontang, while Josh Jacobs scored 19.5 points for LucDart. 

Both teams had some players who struggled this week; Brandin Cooks and Pat Freiermuth each scored less than 6 points for Schoontang, while Jaylen Waddle and Cade Otton both put up under 4 points for LucDart. 

This matchup was a close one all the way to the end, with both teams trading leads throughout the game. Schoontang got off to a strong start with Justin Fields scoring 18 points in the first half, but LucDart quickly answered back with Aaron Rodgers and Josh Jacobs leading them to an early lead in the second half. However, Schoontang managed to stay ahead of LucDart throughout the rest of the game thanks to Nick Chubb's 12 point performance and Davante Adams' monster 34 point game. In the end, it was Russell Wilson's 25 point effort that sealed the deal for LucDart as they managed to pull ahead of Schoontang in the last minute of the game and take third place! 

Congratulations to LucDart on their hard-fought victory! They played an amazing game this week and never gave up despite being down at times during the matchup. Russell Wilson was especially impressive this week as he single-handedly propelled his team to victory with his 25 point performance! 

Too bad for Schoontang - they almost pulled off a come-from-behind win but ultimately fell short due to their lackluster performances from Brandin Cooks and Pat Freiermuth who combined only managed 13 points between them! 

The MVP of this matchup has to go to Russell Wilson who scored 25 points and led his team to victory in dramatic fashion! He was unstoppable this week and proved why he is one of the best quarterbacks in fantasy football today! 

Despite Davante Adams' monster 34 point performance, Nick Chubb can't escape being called out as this weeks biggest bust player after only managing 12 points in what could have been a much bigger contribution from him. 

Final Comments & Final Score: In what was an exciting matchup between two great teams, it was ultimately LucDart who prevailed with a final score of 129.24 - 122.3 over Schoontang! Congratulations again to LucDart on their 3rd place finish in our league this season!

Slicknick11 came into this one looking to make a statement, and they did just that with an impressive 115.64 point total. Meanwhile, sclyden put up 99.38 points in the loss, but still managed to finish the season with 5 wins - not too shabby! The biggest difference maker for Slicknick11 was Tom Brady who scored 43.68 points on his own - nearly half of their total output! On the other side, Daniel Jones led the way for sclyden with 40+ points of his own - an amazing performance that unfortunately wasn't enough to get them over the hump this week. 

Slicknick11 started off slow this season but finished strong with a big win in Week 17! They were led by Tom Brady's spectacular performance and ended up outscoring their opponent by 16+ points - a great way to end their season! 

sclyden gave it their all but unfortunately it wasn't enough as they dropped another game to close out the season at 5-9 overall. Their offense couldn't quite get it going against Slicknick11 despite Daniel Jones' best efforts, proving once again that defense wins championships! 

Tom Brady was without a doubt the MVP of this matchup after putting up 43+ points for Slicknick11 - an absolutely ridiculous stat line! His performance singlehandedly carried his team to victory and made sure they ended their season on a high note! 

It's tough to say anyone performed poorly when your team wins, but Devin Singletary certainly didn't help much after scoring only 0.3 points for sclyden this week - yikes! 

In what was surely one of the most exciting matchups of Week 17, Slicknick11 pulled off an incredible upset against sclyden with a final score of 115.64-99.38! Congratulations to Slicknick11 on ending their season on such a high note - you earned it!

Game 1:

Rickythemer Triumphs Over Schoontang, Moves Up in Standings


Week 4 of the fantasy football season was a close game between Schoontang and Rickythemer. In a battle to remain in playoff contention, Rickythemer emerged with the victory, 129.3 to 105.96. This win moved Rickythemer up to 6th place, ahead of the cutoff by 0 wins but winning the tiebreaker by 31.32 points. On the other hand, Schoontang dropped down to 9th place and is now 1 win behind a spot in the playoffs. 


The MVP for Rickythemer was Mark Andrews who scored 25 points while Schoontang's worst performer was Bryce Young with only 7.16 points. DJ Moore overachieved for Rickythemer today as well, scoring 27.1 points this week and Terry McLaurin also had an impressive outing with 22.6 points on the board for them too.

With this result, both teams have not yet clinched a playoff spot; however they are now closer than before to securing one in weeks to come as Schoontang now has 1 wins on the season while Rickythemer has 2 wins under their belt already. With only 11 weeks remaining until playoffs begin in week 15, each team will need to fight hard for every point from here on out if they wish to make it there successfully and compete for ultimate championship glory! 


Schoontang had a weak performance overall this week despite having some good players such as Bryce Young who unfortunately did not perform up to expectations resulting in their loss against Rickythemer; however they still have time on their side and can turn it around if they play smarter and make better decisions moving forward into next weeks game! 

 
Rickythemer had a solid outing this week which allowed them to move up in standings and put themselves closer towards playoff contention; however they must remain vigilant if they want that final spot as there is still plenty of competition standing between them and sweet victory! With that being said, it looks like we have an exciting end of season ahead of us - may the best team win!

jwalwer81 Dominates in Week 4 Fantasy Football Matchup

In the fourth week of the season, jwalwer81 and slicknick11 faced off in a fantasy football game. At stake was a potential place in the playoffs, with the top six teams going on to compete for the championship title beginning in week 15. League average total team score this week was 117 points.

jwalwer81 came away with an impressive win, 168.32 to 57.88, thanks largely to A.J. Brown's 38.5 point performance which made him the highest scoring WR in the league this week and Puka Nacua's 31.3 points which exceeded expectations for jwalwer81 today as well. The humiliation of slicknick11 was complete when their key players failed to deliver; Deshaun Watson scored 0 points, Mac Jones only 0.7 points, Deebo Samuel only 0.6 points, George Kittle only 1.9 points and Dalvin Cook only 2.8 points - all woefully underachieving from what was expected of them this week.

The game MVP for lalder was Josh Allen who put up an impressive 44.5 points, while Justin Jefferson overachieved with 26.5 points as well.

These amazing performances propelled lalder to the highest score in the league this week at 171.02 points, which was 54 points higher than the league average of 117 points. 

Unfortunately for LucDart, their performance was not enough to secure them a victory as they fell short by 32 points despite scoring over the league average at 139.02 points this week. This loss can partially be attributed to Jerick McKinnon’s 0.7 point performance, which served as a bust for LucDart’s team today; however, Josh Jacobs overachieved with 27.9 points and Tank Dell underachieved with 3.9 points for LucDart as well . 

With such an outstanding performance from lalder (and its star player Josh Allen) in week 4, they have secured their spot at first place and are now two games ahead of the playoff team cutoff with four wins on the season; however, LucDart still has work to do if they want to make it into playoffs as they are currently one win behind a spot in playoffs with only one win on the season thus far .

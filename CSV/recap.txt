Game 3:
Week 7 Showdown: Twest1 Overcomes Poor Performance to Defeat Struggling sclyden 

The week seven matchup between Twest1 and sclyden was a tale of two teams on opposite ends of the spectrum. While Twest1 had playoff aspirations, sclyden was fighting for their first win of the season. With the conclusion of this game, Twest1 moved up in the standings to 8th place while sclyden remained at 12th place (last). 

Twest1 had an off day offensively, scoring 104.18 points which is below league average (121) and far from their season high score of 147 points. Despite this poor performance, they still managed to come away with a victory by 62.88 points due to an even worse showing from sclyden who scored only 41.3 points - the lowest in the league this week. 
Rachaad White led all players on both sides with 15.9 points and earned himself Game MVP honors for his efforts while C.J Stroud was named Bust Of The Game after failing to record any fantasy points whatsoever despite being projected for 11-15 points based on AGSA simulations prior to kick-off. Other notable underachievers for sclyden included Kadarius Toney who recorded 2.3 points and Quentin Johnston who recorded 3 total fantasy points respectively; both were projected for more than double that amount before kickoff as well.. 

With their third win on the season, Twest1 is now tied with 6th place but loses out in tiebreaker scenarios due to having 73 less total team score than those ahead of them in standings; however, according to AGSA simulations they have a 50% chance at making playoffs if they can keep up their current level of play throughout remainder of regular season schedule which concludes in Week 15 . As it stands right now though, neither team has clinched a playoff spot yet so there are still plenty twists and turns left until then!

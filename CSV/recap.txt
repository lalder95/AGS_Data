Game 4:

Lalder Soars to Victory Over iisstupids in Week 10 Fantasy Football Matchup


Week 10 of the fantasy football season has come and gone, and it was a matchup that will be remembered for quite some time.

With the conclusion of this game, lalder is now in first place with seven wins on the season, while iisstupids is now in tenth place with two wins on the season. The playoffs begin in week 15, and lalder is currently four wins ahead of the playoff team cutoff, while iisstupids is two wins behind a spot in the playoffs. 


The league average total team score this week was 118 points, but lalder had an amazing game scoring 165.8 points - nearly 50 points higher than their opponent. T.J. Hockenson was the Game MVP for lalder with 30.4 points, and Ja'Marr Chase and Austin Ekeler also overachieved for lalder today as well, scoring 23.4 points and 21.5 points respectively this week. On the other side of things, iisstupids had a horrible game scoring 70.8 points - which was actually the lowest score in the league this week - leaving them 95 points behind their opponent at the end of regulation time.

TJ Hockenson was not only the Game MVP for lalder today but he also happened to be the highest scoring tight end in all of fantasy football this week! This victory really turned some heads as it was one of the most impressive performances we’ve seen all season long - winning by 95 points! It’s no wonder why AGSA simulations predict that lalder has a 100% chance to make it into playoffs while iisstupids has been given 0% chance to make it into playoffs based on their current record.. 


This matchup between lalder and iisstupids certainly did not disappoint! Both teams came out swinging hard but ultimately it was lalder who emerged victorious with an incredible performance from T J Hockenson leading them to victory! With four weeks left until playoffs begin we can expect some more exciting matchups like this one between these two teams as they battle for playoff positions..  


It looks like lalder is well on its way to securing a spot in playoffs while unfortunately it looks like iisstupids may have already sealed its fate when it comes to making it into postseason play! We can only hope that more games like this one will take place during these last few weeks before playoffs so that we can see some more nail-biting matchups between these two great teams!

Game 1:
Rickythemer Narrowly Clinches Victory Over Schoontang

The fourth week of the fantasy football season has come to a close, and it was a nail-biting matchup between Schoontang and Rickythemer. With the league average total team score for this week being 117 points, both teams had their work cut out for them. 

Schoontang had a weak performance this week, scoring only 105.96 points and now sitting in 9th place with 1 win on the season. The bust of the game for Schoontang was Bryce Young with only 7.16 points. Despite the lackluster performance, Schoontang is still only 1 win away from reaching a playoff spot; however, they have yet to clinch one. 

On the other side of the field, Rickythemer had a solid outing this week scoring 129.3 points - enough to give them 2 wins on the season and 6th place in the standings. The MVP of this matchup was Mark Andrews with 25 points while DJ Moore overachieved by scoring 27.1 points and Terry McLaurin scored 22.6 points as well - both helping Rickythemer to their modest victory over Schoontang by 23.34 points (129.3-105.96). Thanks to their impressive outing, Rickythemer is ahead of the playoff team cutoff by 0 wins but winning the tiebreaker by 31.32 points; however, they have yet to secure a playoff spot either. 

In conclusion, Rickythemer narrowly edged out Schoontang in an intense battle that saw Cole Kmet take home highest scoring TE honors in league this week with 29 points - but it wasn't enough for Schoontang who failed to secure any momentum going into next week's games as they remain 1 win behind a spot in playoffs and Rickythemer remains ahead of playoff team cutoff but without clinching an official spot yet either .

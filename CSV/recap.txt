Game 1:
"The AGS Championship is Here! Who Will Take the Title?" 

Justin Herbert was a force to be reckoned with this week, leading lalder's team with nearly 32 points. Christian McCaffrey put up an impressive 31.3 points for jwalwer81, while Tyreek Hill added 15.7 points to the total score. 

Jordan Akins and Joe Mixon both had lackluster performances, scoring under 6 points each. Dalton Schultz also had a bad week, contributing only 10.2 points to jwalwer81's total score. 

This matchup has been one of the most exciting matchups of the season! Both teams have battled hard all year long to get into this position - and now it all comes down to who can perform best in this game! lalder started off strong right away with Patrick Mahomes at QB, but jwalwer81 quickly answered back with Justin Herbert throwing for over 20 points. D'Andre Swift and James Conner both put up solid scores for lalder, but Christian McCaffrey dominated the backfield for jwalwer81, scoring over 30 points himself! The wide receivers were fairly even across both teams - Justin Jefferson and Ja'Marr Chase combined for over 8 points on lalder's side, while A.J Brown and Tyreek Hill combined for 35 on jwalwer81's side. Tight ends were a bit different - Jordan Akins scored just 2.5 points for lalder while Dalton Schultz scored 24.6 for jwalwer81 - making him the highest scoring tight end in this matchup! 

jwalwer81 has done it again! With an impressive 172 point performance they have taken home their second AGS Championship title! It was an incredible performance from start to finish as they outscored their opponents by 81 points - that is one of the highest margins of victory we've seen in our league all season long! Congratulations on another championship win! 

Unfortunately it wasn't enough for lalder this time around as they fell short of their goal of taking home another championship title. Despite putting up a respectable 91 point performance, it still wasn't enough against the beastly performance from jwalwer81 - proving that sometimes even good isn't quite good enough when you're playing against great teams like them! 

Christian McCaffrey was easily the MVP of this matchup, putting up an outstanding 31 point performance that helped propel his team to victory. He was unstoppable throughout the entire game and showed why he is one of the best players in our league today! 

Joe Mixon had an abysmal performance in this matchup, scoring only 1 point which is one of his lowest scores all season long - ouch! He really let his team down in what could have been a huge game-winning opportunity if he had performed better here today.  

In what will undoubtedly go down as one of the most memorable matchups in AGS history, jwalwer81 took home their second championship title after crushing their opponents 172-91 in what was truly a dominating performance from start to finish. Congratulations again to them on another well-deserved championship win - you earned it!

Game 2:
"Schoontang's Late Push Falls Short, LucDart Secures Third Place" 

Aaron Rodgers and Russell Wilson combined for 44.14 points, leading the way for LucDart. Jerick McKinnon also scored 22.6 points. 

Schoontang was held back by Brandin Cooks' 7.9 points, Pat Freiermuth's 6.6 points, and Brian Robinson's 8.7 points. 

This matchup had a little bit of everything! Aaron Rodgers threw for 18.56 points while Russell Wilson added 25.58 on the ground in a thrilling QB duel between two of the league's best signal callers. Josh Jacobs was able to find the end zone twice to add 19.5 points to LucDart's total score, while CeeDee Lamb made some big plays with 21 points on the day as well. Justin Fields led Schoontang with 18.2 passing points plus another 16 rushing yards that rounded out his total score to 18.3 points; Nick Chubb added 12 more on the ground for Schoontang but it wasn't enough against LucDart's balanced attack from their skill players and QBs alike! 

Despite an early season slump, LucDart was able to turn things around at just the right time and finish off their season strong with a third place finish! With Aaron Rodgers throwing for nearly 20 points and Russell Wilson adding over 25 on the ground, this team is ready for next season already! 

Schoontang had a great chance to make up some ground in this matchup but unfortunately couldn't quite get there in the end despite Justin Fields' valiant efforts - they just didn't have enough big plays from their skill players down the stretch when they needed them most! 

Aaron Rodgers was undoubtedly this matchup's MVP player - he threw for 18+ points despite being injured earlier in the week and put his team in position to win with his late-game heroics! 

Pat Freiermuth only managed 6 measly fantasy football points today - what a letdown from one of Schoontang's most reliable targets all year long!  
 
Final Comments & Final Score: In what turned out to be one of our league's best matchups of the entire season, LucDart emerged victorious with 129 total fantasy football points compared to Schoontang's 122 - congratulations on a hard-fought 3rd place finish!

Game 4:
"Slicknick11 Outclasses sclyden in Final Fantasy Matchup" 

The top scorers for Slicknick11 were Mac Jones, who scored over 20 points, and Tom Brady who scored nearly 44 points. Dalvin Cook also had a decent game with 6.4 points. 

Meanwhile, sclyden's top scorers were Daniel Jones and DeVonta Smith, both of whom scored over 20 points, while Jeff Wilson and Leonard Fournette both had double-digit performances with 10.6 and 8.7 points respectively. DK Metcalf was the biggest bust for sclyden with only 1.3 points.  

This matchup was all about Slicknick11’s superior firepower against sclyden’s underperforming players. Despite having a few decent scores from Daniel Jones and DeVonta Smith, there wasn't enough production from the rest of the roster to keep up with the consistent performance from Slicknick11's starting lineup. In the end it was an easy victory for Slicknick11 as they outscored their opponent by 16 points to close out the season on a high note. 

Slicknick11 deserves credit for putting together a well balanced team that could stay competitive throughout the season despite being one of the lower ranked teams in our league this year. They can be proud knowing they ended their season on a positive note with a win over sclyden in this final matchup of the year! 

On the other hand, sclyden had several key players underperform this week which cost them dearly in this matchup and ultimately doomed them to defeat in their last game of the season. With some better luck or more consistent play from their starters, they could have easily put themselves into playoff contention instead of finishing in 9th place overall! 

The MVP for this matchup has to go to Mac Jones who put up an impressive 20+ point performance as he led Slicknick11 to victory! The Biggest Bust would have to be DK Metcalf who despite being one of sclyden's highest drafted players scored only 1 point this week!  

It was an exciting finish for both teams as they battled it out until the very end but it was Slicknick11 who came out on top with 115 total points compared to 99 total points by sclyden!

Game 5:
"Rickythemer Comes Up Big, Puts PJTiffany39 in Their Place" 

Top scorers for Rickythemer included Sam Darnold with 27.64 points, Austin Ekeler with 32.1 points, and DJ Moore with 23.7 points. On the other side of the field, Carson Wentz scored 6.42 points for PJTiffany39, Isiah Pacheco put up 12.9 points, and David Montgomery managed 5.6 points. 

The matchup was a lopsided affair from the start as Rickythemer's team had an impressive showing from their starters while PJTiffany39 struggled to get any momentum going on offense. Mike Evans was particularly impressive for Rickythemer as he put up 48.7 points and was the clear standout of the week for his team. On the other hand, Tyler Lockett was a major disappointment for PJTiffany39, scoring only 5.7 points on the day despite being one of their top picks prior to kickoff. 

In what could be considered a statement win by Rickythemer, they managed to outscore PJTiffany39 by nearly 100 total points this week - a staggering margin that would have been unthinkable at the beginning of this season! With this performance, Rickythemer proves that they are still one of the top teams in our league and are certainly capable of making a deep run into the playoffs if they can keep up this level of play over the next few weeks! 

PJTiffany39 were unable to keep up with their opponents' high-powered offense and were left in the dust after halftime when it became clear that their roster simply wasn't performing at its peak level this week. Jared Goff led his team in scoring with 28.4 but it wasn't nearly enough to make up for their lacklustre performance overall - proving once again that even the best players need help from their teammates if they want to be successful! 

The MVP of this matchup goes to Mike Evans who put up an astonishing 48.7 points on Sunday - more than double what any other player on either team scored! On top of that, he also provided some much needed leadership and energy throughout the game which helped propel his team towards victory! The biggest bust award goes to Joshua Palmer who failed to score a single point despite being expected to perform well due to his recent hot streak in our league! 

In what can only be described as an absolute blowout between two top contenders in our league, Rickythemer came out on top with an incredible 187.66 total points compared to PJTiffany39's 95.52 total points! It looks like Rickythemer is here to stay and we can expect them make some noise down the stretch as we enter into playoff season later this year!

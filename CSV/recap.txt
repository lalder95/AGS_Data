Game 1:
Twest1 Secures Playoff Spot with Narrow Victory Over Rickythemer 

The week 13 matchup between Twest1 and Rickythemer was a crucial one for both teams. With the playoffs beginning in week 15, this game could make or break their season. Twest1 entered the game in 6th place with 6 wins on the season while Rickythemer entered in 9th place with 4 wins on the season. 

Twest1 had a great outing this week, scoring 156.56 points which was over 30 points higher than their opponent's score of 135.26 points. Deebo Samuel led the way for Twest1 as he earned MVP honors by scoring 35.8 points, while Derrick Henry also overachieved by putting up 25 points for his team. On the other side, Terry McLaurin had a tough day and scored 0 points while Clyde Edwards-Helaire underperformed with only 2.4 points scored for Rickythemer. Mike Evans did have an impressive performance though, scoring 29.2 points to help his team stay competitive throughout the game despite falling short at the end of it all. 

Rickythemer put up a good fight but ultimately fell short of victory due to Geno Smith's stellar performance for Twest1 who scored 35.96 points on top of Deebo Samuel's MVP worthy performance earlier mentioned above; giving them just enough to edge out their opponents by 21.3 points and secure themselves a playoff spot according to AGSA simulations which give them 100% chance of making it into post-season play now that they have 7 wins on the season compared to Rickythemer's 4 wins which has eliminated them from playoff contention altogether at this point in time.. 

In conclusion, Twest1 came away victorious after an intense battle against Rickythemer and secured themselves a spot in playoffs come week 15; however they still need another win or two if they want to guarantee themselves home field advantage when post-season play begins next month!

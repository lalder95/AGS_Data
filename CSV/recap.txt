Twest1 entered the game with 6 wins on the season, needing one more victory to secure a playoff spot. Rickythemer, meanwhile, had 4 wins on the season and needed a miracle to stay alive in the race. The league average total team score this week was 125 points, but both teams managed to exceed that mark with Twest1 scoring 156.56 points and Rickythemer scoring 135.26 points.

Despite exceeding the league average total team score this week, it wasn't enough as Twest1 came away with a modest 21 point win (156.56-135.26). This victory put Twest1 1 win ahead of the playoff cutoff and secured their spot in playoffs which begin in week 15; however they have yet to clinch it officially due to AGSA simulations giving them only a 100% chance of making it in based on their current standings.. On the other hand, despite having an impressive outing this week, Rickythemer is officially out of playoff contention with 4 wins on the season and no chance at making it into postseason play this year..

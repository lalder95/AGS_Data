Game 1:
Narrow Victory Sees LucDart Edge Out Rickythemer in Week 9

The ninth week of the fantasy football season saw a close contest between Rickythemer and LucDart, with the latter ultimately emerging victorious. With the conclusion of this game, LucDart is now in sixth place while Rickythemer is in ninth. 

Rickythemer had a tough outing, scoring 75.78 points - well below the league average of 102 points for this week. This was largely due to Tony Jones underperforming with only 2.7 points, as well as Geno Smith's disastrous 2.68 point showing. Despite these poor performances, it wasn't enough to keep them from their narrow loss to LucDart by 8.82 points. 

LucDart also scored below the league average with 84.6 points, but it was enough to get them the win over Rickythemer and put them one win above the playoff team cutoff mark with four wins on the season. Josh Jacobs overperformed for LucDart with 21.8 points and Stefon Diggs earned MVP honors with 22.6 points on the day - both crucial contributions that helped secure their victory today. 

Based on AGSA simulations, LucDart has an 83% chance of making the playoffs while Rickythemer has only a 4% chance despite being just one win behind a spot in the playoffs at three wins on the season. With just six weeks remaining until playoffs begin in week 15, both teams will need to bring their A-game if they want to make it into postseason play this year!

Brown who scored 27 and 19.6 points respectively. On the other hand, mlthomas5095 had a very bad game scoring 66.92 points due to poor performances from Nelson Agholor (1.2), Allen Robinson (2) and Gerald Everett (3.8). Isaiah Spiller was particularly disappointing as he failed to score any points at all - making him the bust of the game for mlthomas5095. 

With three weeks left until the playoffs begin in week 15, jwalwer81 is now three wins ahead of the playoff team cutoff and has been given a 99% chance to make it into the playoffs based on AGSA simulations; however, they have not yet clinched a spot in the playoffs just yet.

In summary, jwalwer81 had an outstanding performance this week against mlthomas5095 – winning by an unprecedented 71.88 point margin – and are now well-positioned to make it into the playoffs if they can maintain their current level of play over their final three games of the regular season

Game 1:


Stunning Start Propels lalder to Dominant Week 1 Win

In a rivalry renewed, lalder left no doubt about their readiness for the 2022 fantasy season, steamrolling past jwalwer81 by a whopping 44.7 points in the teams' Week 1 matchup. With the decisive 154.42-109.72 victory, lalder seized first place in the standings and control of the series history, having now won 3 of 8 all-time meetings between the foes.

After besting jwalwer81 158.8-135.7 last time out, lalder picked up right where they left off thanks to massive performances from RB Saquon Barkley (33.2 points) and QB Josh Allen (35.18 points). Barkley, the Game MVP, posted the top score by any RB in the league this week, while Allen wildly overachieved expectations. On the flip side, jwalwer81 saw top projected scorer Amon-Ra St. Brown crater to just 4.3 points after his breakout 2021. TE Dalton Kincaid was jwalwer81's biggest disappointment, mustering only 2.1 points one week after the team had celebrated his selection.  

With 15 weeks until the playoffs, both teams still have over 80% odds to qualify according to simulations. But lalder's Week 1 explosion places them atop the league with a 1-0 record, while jwalwer81 sits near the bottom at 0-1. One more win would essentially punch lalder's postseason ticket, while jwalwer81 likely needs to string together victories immediately to avoid an uphill climb. For now, all the arrows point up for lalder after this statement result.

Game 2:


Achane Leads Schoontang to Nail-Biting Week 1 Victory

In their 8th all-time meeting, familiar foes Schoontang and LucDart faced off to open the fantasy season. With the playoffs still distant, both teams entered with equal 3-3 records in their rivalry and championship aspirations. 

The two teams kept pace early, but Schoontang pulled ahead behind an MVP performance from De'Von Achane. Achane erupted for 23 points, leading Schoontang to a solid 114.46. LucDart struggled thanks to a bust game from Aaron Rodgers, who woefully underperformed with just 10.58 points.

When the final whistle blew, Schoontang had narrowly edged their rival by just 5.68 points. The 114.46 - 108.78 victory moved Schoontang to 4th place with a 1-0 record. At 0-1, LucDart slipped to 9th in the standings. 

Schoontang now sits just one win from a playoff spot, with AGSA simulations giving them a 38% postseason chance. For LucDart, the outlook remains murky. At one win back of the playoffs, AGSA gives them just a 34% chance to play beyond week 15.

The rivals likely won't have to wait long for a rematch. But for now, Schoontang emerges victorious in this opening week thriller.

Game 3:


A Nail-Biting Fantasy Football Battle Ends in Victory for jalder64

In a high-scoring fantasy football matchup that came down to the wire, jalder64 narrowly defeated mlthomas5095 by a score of 131.88 to 130.1. These rivals have faced each other 7 times before with the series tied 3-3, but jalder64 came out on top this week by a mere 1.78 points.

Despite scoring over the 111-point league average, mlthomas5095 couldn't keep pace with jalder64's 131.88 points - the second highest total in the league this week. Baker Mayfield was the star of the show for mlthomas5095, overachieving with a whopping 37.66 points to lead all players in scoring. However, it wasn't enough to counter big games from Chris Godwin (22.3 points), Alvin Kamara (22 points) and others on jalder64's squad. 

The victory moves jalder64 into second place with a 1-0 record. Meanwhile, mlthomas5095 drops to seventh place at 0-1. While neither has clinched a playoff berth yet, simulations give jalder64 a 79% chance to make the postseason compared to just 25% for mlthomas5095. 

With 15 weeks left in the fantasy season, there is still plenty of time for redemption. But for now, bragging rights belong to jalder64 - who has now won three straight matchups against this foe. It was a battle that came down to the bitter end, but in fantasy football, every point counts. This nail-biting finish showed jalder64 has the mettle to close out a tight game.

Game 4:


Deebo's Late Heroics Lift Twest1 to Victory in Thriller Over Rival

In a matchup between long-time fantasy football rivals, Twest1 edged out aintEZBNwheezE by the slimmest of margins in week 1. With the playoffs still far in the distance, both teams came into the contest with visions of a Cinderella run. 

Though Twest1 had historically dominated the series, aintEZBNwheezE entered with momentum after securing bragging rights in their last showdown. However, it was Samuel who dashed those hopes this time, willing Twest1 to a 109.58 to 103.5 win. 

Both sides struggled mightily to muster offense. But despite lackluster showings across the board, Twest1 did just enough to prevail. The duo still has work ahead to ensure postseason glory, with inconsistency threatening their championship aspirations. 

Conversely, aintEZBNwheezE finds their playoff hopes already on thin ice after just one week. Edwards was a notable letdown, while Mostert failed to ignite hopes of a comeback. Still, with ample season left, aintEZBNwheezE believes they have the talent to turn it around.

In the end, it was Deebo's 18.7 points that made the difference, allowing Twest1 to survive and advance. Ride high while they can, as next week brings a new set of challenges. For now, the bragging rights belong to them.

Fantasy Football Foes Face Off in Fierce Week 1 Fight 

In this long-running fantasy football rivalry's latest chapter, SnackDaddy2907 emerged victorious against Rickythemer by a score of 129.02 to 105.52. With playoff positioning hanging in the balance, the 23.5-point margin of victory places further pressure on the struggling Rickythemer squad.  

Having met six prior times, seasoned campaigners SnackDaddy2907 and Rickythemer resumed their rivalry to launch the new season. SnackDaddy2907 entered with a 3-2 historical upper hand, but Rickythemer won their last scrap by a mere 1.48 points. 

This hard-fought week 1 win boosts first-place SnackDaddy2907 to a 75% chance of securing a coveted playoff berth according to simulations. Meanwhile, Rickythemer’s hopes are fading fast down in 10th place with just a 30% postseason probability. 

The game’s MVP Tyreek Hill exploded for 26 points to spearhead his team’s winning attack. However, SnackDaddy2907 equally owes thanks to unexpected overachiever Joe Mixon’s 26.8 points. In contrast, Rickythemer suffered from complete bust Dylan Laube’s goose egg.  

With 15 intense weeks until the playoffs, both sides have ample time to reverse fortunes. But for now, the bragging rights belong firmly to SnackDaddy2907 after seizing a gritty early victory over a familiar foe.

While both teams scored below the 111-point league average, Delusional1 rode the standout 21.6-point performance of Rhamondre Stevenson to a comfortable 34.1 point victory.

This win marks Delusional1's 5th in 7 all-time meetings against iisstupids. More importantly, it puts Delusional1 at 1-0 on the young season and in 6th place, while iisstupids falls to 0-1 and dwells in the basement. 

Based on simulations, Delusional1 now has a 36% chance to make the playoffs that start in week 15.

While the two teams seem headed in opposite directions, there is still time for iisstupids to turn things around before the playoff push begins. But for now, Delusional1 can enjoy having both the series lead and early season momentum.

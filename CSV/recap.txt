Game 1:
"AGS Championship Showdown: Lalder vs. Jwalwer81!"

Patrick Mahomes and D'Andre Swift put up huge numbers for lalder, with 31.52 and 27.7 points respectively. Justin Herbert and Christian McCaffrey also had big weeks for jwalwer81, scoring 20.68 and 31.3 points respectively. 

Unfortunately for lalder, Ja'Marr Chase had a rough week, only managing to rack up 0 points in the championship game. Joe Mixon also had a poor outing with only 1.2 points scored on the day. On the other hand, jwalwer81's Amon-Ra St Brown was held to just 10.2 points and Keenan Allen had a quiet 11.8 point performance in the title game as well. 

Both teams came into this matchup with strong records of 8 wins and 6 losses (lalder) and 10 wins and 4 losses (jwalwer81). This was an exciting matchup between two of the top teams in our league this year, with both rosters stacked with talent! Patrick Mahomes led off strong for lalder but it wasn't enough to keep up with jwalwer81's offensive firepower throughout the week as they pulled away late in the game! Tyreek Hill was instrumental in getting jwalwer81 over the edge, scoring 15.7 points on the day while A.J Brown put up 19.7 points to help seal their victory! 

It was a spectacular performance from jwalwer81 as they managed to break through lalder's defense to score 172 total points on their way to a decisive win! They are your AGS Champions of 2022! Congratulations! 

On the other side of things, it was a tough loss for lalder who put up 91 total points on the day but just didn't have enough offensive firepower to keep up with jwalwer81's explosive offense! It could have been any team's championship this year but unfortunately it wasn't meant to be for them this time around! 

The Matchup MVP goes out to Christian McCaffrey who put up an impressive 31.3 points on his way to helping jwalwer81 secure their championship victory! The Biggest Bust Player goes out to Ja'Marr Chase who couldn't manage even one point in what could have been his last fantasy football game ever (depending on how long he decides to stay in fantasy football!). 

It all comes down to this - after 17 weeks of intense competition, it is finally over and we have our champions - jwalwer81 - who take home their first ever AGS Championship trophy after defeating lalder 172-91 in an exciting matchup that will go down as one of our most memorable games ever! Congratulations again - you earned it!!

Game 2:
Schoontang's Season Finale Falls Short Against LucDart

Aaron Rodgers (18.6), Jerick McKinnon (22.6), Josh Jacobs (19.5), Russell Wilson (25.6). 
Aaron Rodgers had a solid game with 18.6 points, but it was Jerick McKinnon who really put up a show for LucDart, scoring 22.6 points and leading the team to victory. Josh Jacobs also had 19.5 points, while Russell Wilson added an impressive 25.6 points to the total tally for LucDart. 

Brandin Cooks (4.6), Pat Freiermuth (3.7), Diontae Johnson (5.5). 
Brandin Cooks had a slow day, only putting up 4.6 points for Schoontang, while Pat Freiermuth and Diontae Johnson both scored under 6 points each for their respective teams - not enough to make a difference in this matchup! 

This was the final game of the season and it certainly lived up to expectations! Both teams were neck-and-neck throughout the game, trading leads back and forth until the very end when LucDart finally pulled away with a 7 point victory over Schoontang, 129-122! Justin Fields led Schoontang with 18 points, while Aaron Rodgers led LucDart with 18 points as well - talk about symmetry! Davante Adams had an incredible 34 point performance for Schoontang, but unfortunately it wasn't enough to overcome LucDart's balanced attack from all of its players! 

The victory was sweet for LucDart who finished off their season with a 12-2 record and will now move on to compete in the playoffs! They have been one of the most consistent teams all year long and this win is just another example of why they are so successful - their ability to get contributions from all positions on their roster! 

Unfortunately for Schoontang, they ended their season on a sour note after coming up just short against LucDart in this matchup despite having some great performances from Davante Adams and Justin Fields - two players that can carry any team if given enough opportunities! Maybe next year they'll be able to finish off strong instead of falling short at the end like today...  

The MVP award goes out to Russell Wilson who put up an impressive 25 point performance that helped lead his team to victory over Schoontang! He has been one of the most consistent performers all year long and his performance today was no different - he showed why he is one of the best quarterbacks in fantasy football today! 

The biggest bust award goes out to Diontae Johnson who only put up 5 points despite being expected to score much more than that based on his past performances this season! He has been one of Schoontang's top players all year long but unfortunately he couldn't come through when it mattered most today...  

Final Comments & Final Score: In the end, it was LucDart who came out on top with a 129-122 victory over Schoontang in what turned out to be an exciting matchup between two top teams in our league this year! Congratulations go out to both teams for making it this far in what has been an incredibly competitive season - we are looking forward to seeing how these two teams do in the playoffs next week!

Game 4:
"Slicknick11 Finishes the Season with a Win Over Sclyden" 

Daniel Jones put up an impressive 40.18 points, while Devanta Smith had 20.5 and Jeff Wilson had 10.6. 

Zack Moss and Adam Thielen both scored under 6 points, while Rachaad White put up a measly 0.3 points. 

Slicknick11 was able to overcome the low scores from Zack Moss and Adam Thielen, thanks to the huge performance of Mac Jones who scored nearly 44 points, Tom Brady who scored over 7 points, and Dalvin Cook who scored over 6 points. On the other side of the field, Daniel Jones led Sclyden with over 40 points in what was a great performance for him in his last game of the season. However it wasn't enough as DeVonta Smith's 20 point performance couldn't make up for the poor performances from Leonard Fournette (8.7) and Dallas Goedert (7.5). 

Slicknick11 ends their season on a high note with a win over Sclyden! They finished 9th place overall in this league, and ended strong with a 115 point performance that included big games from Mac Jones and Tom Brady! 

Sclyden finishes off their season with yet another loss after being outscored by 16 points by Slicknick11 this week! Their 99 point performance was not good enough to get them into the playoffs this year - maybe they should have gone out and gotten some better players earlier in the season? 

The Matchup MVP has to go to Mac Jones who put up an incredible 43+ point performance that helped lead Slicknick11 to victory! 

It's easy to pick out Zach Moss as this week's biggest bust - he only managed 2+ points which is far below his usual output! 

In what was an exciting matchup between two teams looking for one last win before wrapping up their season, Slicknick11 comes away victorious with a final score of 115-99! Congratulations to Slicknick11 on finishing 9th place in our league this year!

Game 5:
"Rickythemer Outlasts PJTiffany39 in Week 17 Thriller"

Top scorers for this matchup included Sam Darnold who scored nearly 28 points and Austin Ekeler who scored 32 points. Mike Evans was the top scorer of the week with 48.7 points, while DJ Moore had a solid game with 23.7 points. 

At the other end of the spectrum, Joshua Palmer was held scoreless, as was Tyler Lockett on the opposing team. Carson Wentz only managed 6.4 points and David Montgomery only put up 5.6 points for PJTiffany39's team. 

This matchup was a battle all the way to the wire as both teams had strong performances from their star players, but ultimately Rickythemer pulled away in the second half with some clutch performances from their roster. Mike Evans put on an absolute clinic for them, racking up 48.7 points and setting a new personal best in fantasy scoring this season. Meanwhile Geno Smith came through in a pinch when they needed him most, finishing with 21.1 points after taking over for Sam Darnold late in the game. 

It was an impressive victory for Rickythemer who showed great depth and poise when it mattered most, while PJTiffany39 simply couldn't keep pace despite some good showings from Raheem Mostert (23.1) and Jared Goff (28.4). In the end, Rickythemer's 187.66 total points were enough to outlast PJTiffany39's 95.52 total points and secure a win for their team in Week 17 of our 2022 Fantasy Football League!
